# Case Study: Employee Retention Prediction Model

## Executive Summary
Developed a predictive model achieving 74% accuracy in identifying at-risk employees 
using machine learning. Key finding: tenure in first 2 years is 59% of retention 
risk. Recommended targeted interventions with 1,250%-2,500% ROI.

## The Challenge
- Organization experienced 35% annual attrition (~$4.15M cost)
- Leadership wanted to: (1) identify who would leave, (2) understand why, (3) 
  determine interventions

## Solution Approach

### Phase 1: Data Integration
- Combined HRIS system (tenure, roles, employment status)
- Merged engagement survey data (3,120+ sentiment scores)
- Analyzed 50+ exit interview documents
- Cleaned and standardized department naming inconsistencies

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering
- Calculated tenure in years from hire dates
- Created tenure bands (0-1yr, 1-2yr, 2-5yr, 5-10yr, 10+yr)
- Scored engagement from sentiment (Positive=1.0, Neutral=0.5, Negative=0.0)
- Encoded categorical variables (department, job title)

### Phase 3: Predictive Modeling
- Split data: 80% training, 20% testing (stratified by attrition)
- Tested three models:
  - Logistic Regression: 68% ROC AUC
  - Random Forest: 74% ROC AUC ← Selected
  - XGBoost: 71% ROC AUC
- Selected Random Forest for balance of accuracy and interpretability

### Phase 4: Validation
- Tested on hold-out 20% dataset
- Compared predictions against exit interview themes
- Validated attrition rates by tenure band

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Tenure Dominates (59% importance)
- 0-1 years tenure: 65% attrition rate
- 1-2 years tenure: 48% attrition rate
- 2+ years tenure: 12% attrition rate
- **Implication**: First-year experience is critical

### Finding 2: Job Title Matters (26% importance)
- Frontline roles show higher inherent turnover
- Administrative roles show lower turnover
- **Implication**: Some roles need different support strategies

### Finding 3: Culture is Secondary (15% combined)
- Department culture: 6%
- Branch/location: 3%
- Comment participation: 2.5%
- Engagement score: 2.4%
- **Implication**: While important, not the primary lever

### Exit Interview Root Causes (50+ departures)
| Reason | Mentions | % | Rank |
|--------|----------|-----|------|
| Leadership/Supervision | 32 | 59% | 1 |
| Workload/Burnout | 27 | 50% | 2 |
| Limited Growth | 19 | 35% | 3 |
| Culture/Inclusion | 13 | 24% | 4 |
| Compensation | 8 | 15% | 5 |

**Critical Insight**: Pay barely registers. Management quality and workload are 
the drivers.

## Risk Segmentation Results
- **High Risk** (165 employees): Model correctly identifies 74% of the time
- **Medium Risk** (275 employees): Watch for decline into high-risk
- **Low Risk** (477 employees): Stable trajectory

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (30 days)
- Audit the 90-day onboarding program
- Identify quick wins on psychological safety
- Conduct stay interviews with 275 medium-risk employees

### Short-Term (60-90 days)
- Launch supervisor training in high-turnover departments ($50K)
- Redesign onboarding with mentorship component ($25K)
- Review workload distribution in high-burnout departments ($10K)

### Long-Term (6-12 months)
- Implement career pathway program
- Establish quarterly culture monitoring
- Tie manager bonuses to retention metrics

## Business Case
- **Investment**: $100,000
- **Risk Exposure**: $4.15M (166 × $25K replacement cost)
- **Conservative ROI**: Retain 50 employees = $1.25M saved (1,250% ROI)
- **Realistic ROI**: Retain 75-100 employees = $1.875M-$2.5M saved (1,875%-2,500% ROI)
- **Break-even**: 4 retained employees

## Limitations & Future Improvements
- Engagement data limited to 2024-2025; longer history would strengthen analysis
- Department-level engagement scores mask individual variation
- Model trained on historical attrition; future patterns may differ
- Recommendation: Retrain model quarterly with new data

## Conclusion
Tenure is the dominant retention factor, making first-year experience the primary 
lever. This is addressable through concrete interventions (onboarding redesign, 
mentorship, supervisor training) with strong ROI. The $100K investment breaks even 
at 4 retained employees; expected retention of 50-100 represents substantial value.
